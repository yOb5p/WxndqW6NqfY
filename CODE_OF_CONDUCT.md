Delta Analytics Code of Conduct 
-----

[Delta Analytics](http://www.deltanalytics.org/) has two parallel goals. First, we bridge the skill gap faced by non-profits by providing free data consulting. Second, we build technical capacity in communities around the world to help democratize access to machine learning and data tools. We are a non-profit run entirely without any full-time staff; instead, our work is possible because of the volunteer efforts of a community of data professionals.
We value the participation of each member of the Delta Analytics community and want all our members to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all members are expected to show respect, dignity, and courtesy to others.
To make clear what is expected, all people affiliated in any way with the Delta Analytics as a teaching or data fellow are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code of conduct at all times.

Our Standards

Delta Analytics is dedicated to providing a welcoming experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, or religion (or lack thereof), or socio-economic status. We believe that all members of Delta Analytics are entitled to interact in an environment that is free of harassment, bullying, and discrimination.
We encourage all of our members to contribute to creating a welcoming environment by:

- Being kind to others
- Behaving professionally
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Divulging sensitive or confidential data and information
- Harassment of anyone in any form, including:
  - Bullying or other actions that create an intimidating, humiliating or uncomfortable environment
  - Violent threats or language directed against another person

  - Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Other conduct that is inappropriate for a professional audience with diverse backgrounds

Participants asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply with the aforementioned guidelines immediately.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.

Procedure For A Violating Incident 
------

If you believe that you have been treated contrary to this Code of Conduct you should do the following: If you feel safe, approach the person directly and request the person’s behavior to stop. If that does not resolve the incident to your satisfaction or you feel uncomfortable speaking with the person directly, please surface immediately to a member of the [leadership team](http://www.deltanalytics.org/leadership-team.html), in-person, or electronically. If possible, document the incident by including dates, times, places, names of individuals involved, and any witnesses. 

In response, members of Delta Analytics’s leadership team will promptly:  

- Meet with each person involved individually and privately.
- The leadership team will exercise its best efforts to keep these conversations confidential and will not divulge sensitive information to other members of the Delta community unless it receives permission from all direct parties involved to do so.
- Decide the appropriate course of action and communicate it transparently to the parties involved.
- Maintain a private record of the incident, in order to identify and prevent undesirable repeated behavior.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, Delta Analytics may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expelling the offender from an event, or including permanently banning the offender from the group after the offender has had an opportunity to be heard in front of the leadership team.
